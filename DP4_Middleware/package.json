  "description": "Like the Observer, the 'Middleware Pattern'(MP) -- a.k.a 'Mediator' -- is a behavioral pattern. The MP reduces complexity of communication between multiple objects/classes by introducing an object/class that coordinates interaction between two sets of objects. Thus, objects no longer interact directly but rather all communication is carried out by a mediator object/class.",
